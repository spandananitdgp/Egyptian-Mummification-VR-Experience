{"name":"Egyptian Mummification VR Experience","tagline":"Experience Time Travel To The 2600 B.C Egyptian Mummification Era","body":"# Description\r\n    \r\nThis virtual reality experience leverages the telepresence and takes the user back to about 2600 B.C, and lets user be a part of the Egyptian mummification process. This immersive VR experience can be deployed to Google Cardboard or Oculus Rift. It is developed using Unity 3D Gaming Engine. This project is being developed as a class project for the Virtual Reality (CIS6930) class at University of Florida.\r\n\r\nThe team consists of 3 graduate students:\r\n\r\n- Izhar Shaikh (https://github.com/its-izhar)\r\n\r\n- Sayak Biswas (https://github.com/sayakbiswas)\r\n\r\n- Spandana Gangisetty (https://github.com/spandananitdgp)\r\n\r\n# Learning Objective\r\n\r\nAfter this VR experience users will be able to comprehend the complete mummification process according to the rituals of 2600 B.C Egyptians. \r\n\r\n# How elements in the experience increased the user Sense of Presence?\r\n\r\n- **Directional audio** : Instead of using GUIs in the virtual environment we used directional audio to help the user with navigation and since it is relevant to the time of the scene to increase Sense of Presence\r\n- **Teleportation from Transitional Environment to Virtual Environment** : As described in the research paper by Eric Ragan et. al. ([Studying the Effects of Stereo, Head Tracking, and Field of Regard on a Small-Scale Spatial Judgment Task](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261311&tag=1)) a transition from a Transitional Environment to the Virtual Environment before starting the actual VR experience significantly increases the subjective and behavioral measures of Sense of Presence. We have effectively utilized this fact in our VR experience by transporting the user from a replica of the laboratory, where the experiment is being conducted to and back from the Egyptian scene through a portal. \r\n- **First person active user interaction** : Since the user himself is the one who is actively performing the mummification ritual and interacting with the objects in the environment, his sense of being \"there\" is significantly higher when compared to a third person user perspective.\r\n- **Elimination of user interaction with experimenter by introducing audio instructions** : Throughout the experience the user need not interact with the experimenter as all the instructions for both navigation and steps for performing mummification are incorporated as the part of the audio effects throughout the experience.\r\n\r\n# How the Intro and Outro increased the user's Sense of Presence?\r\n\r\n- When user exits the portal in virtual environment and comes back to transitional environment, he picks up a souvenir from the scene which he/she receives in real environment as soon as he/she takes of the HMD. This increases the Sense of Presence.\r\n\r\n# Analysis of \"Sense of Presence\"\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/spandananitdgp/Egyptian-Mummification-VR-Experience/blob/master/SOPEval.PNG)\r\n\r\n# Education of Evaluation\r\n\r\n!(http://s23.postimg.org/txovssz9n/SOPEval.png)\r\n\r\n# References\r\n1.
