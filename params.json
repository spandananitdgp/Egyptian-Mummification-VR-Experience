{"name":"Egyptian Mummification VR Experience","tagline":"Experience Time Travel To The 2600 B.C Egyptian Mummification Era","body":"# Description\r\n    \r\nThis virtual reality experience leverages the telepresence and takes the user back to about 2600 B.C, and lets user be a part of the Egyptian mummification process. This immersive VR experience can be deployed to Google Cardboard or Oculus Rift. It is developed using Unity 3D Gaming Engine. This project is being developed as a class project for the Virtual Reality (CIS6930) class at University of Florida.\r\n\r\nThe team consists of 3 graduate students:\r\n\r\n- Izhar Shaikh (https://github.com/its-izhar)\r\n\r\n- Sayak Biswas (https://github.com/sayakbiswas)\r\n\r\n- Spandana Gangisetty (https://github.com/spandananitdgp)\r\n\r\n# Learning Objective\r\n\r\nAfter this VR experience users will be able to comprehend the complete mummification process according to the rituals of 2600 B.C Egyptians. \r\n\r\n# How elements in the experience increased the user Sense of Presence?\r\n\r\n- **Directional audio** : Instead of using GUIs in the virtual environment we used directional audio to help the user with navigation and since it is relevant to the time of the scene to increase Sense of Presence\r\n- **Teleportation from Transitional Environment to Virtual Environment** : As described in the research paper by Eric Ragan et. al. ([Studying the Effects of Stereo, Head Tracking, and Field of Regard on a Small-Scale Spatial Judgment Task](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6261311&tag=1)) a transition from a Transitional Environment to the Virtual Environment before starting the actual VR experience significantly increases the subjective and behavioral measures of Sense of Presence. We have effectively utilized this fact in our VR experience by transporting the user from a replica of the laboratory, where the experiment is being conducted to and back from the Egyptian scene through a portal. \r\n- **First person active user interaction** : Since the user himself is the one who is actively performing the mummification ritual and interacting with the objects in the environment, his sense of being \"there\" is significantly higher when compared to a third person user perspective.\r\n- **Elimination of user interaction with experimenter by introducing audio instructions** : Throughout the experience the user need not interact with the experimenter as all the instructions for both navigation and steps for performing mummification are incorporated as the part of the audio effects throughout the experience.\r\n\r\n# How the Intro and Outro increased the user's Sense of Presence?\r\nIntro - [Scientists Open Egyptian Mummy Coffin in Chicago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC9-2bRia4Q)\r\n\r\n- When user exits the portal in virtual environment and comes back to transitional environment, he picks up a souvenir from the scene which he/she receives in real environment as soon as he/she takes of the HMD. This increases the Sense of Presence.\r\n\r\n# Results\r\n## Analysis of \"Sense of Presence\"\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/spandananitdgp/Egyptian-Mummification-VR-Experience/blob/master/SOPEval.PNG?raw=true)\r\n\r\n**Question 1**: Please rate your sense of being in the Egypt VR, on the following scale from 1 to 7, where 7 represents your normal experience of being in a place. (**Average - 6**)\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the project we have implemented directional audio and also added intro and outro to increase the SOP of a person and it gave us an average rating of 6 for the above question\r\n\r\n**Question 2**: To what extent were there times during the experience when the Egypt VR was the reality for you? (**Average - 5.83**)\r\n\r\nWe have implemented this experience in first person perspective so that the user feels connected to the environment throughout the VR experience which makes the user feel it is more towards reality than a virtual experience.\r\n\r\n**Question 3**: When you think back about your experience, do you think of the Egypt VR more as images that you saw, or more as somewhere that you visited? (**Average - 6.5**)\r\n\r\nSince the user enters the virtual environment via a transitional environment, he /she felt that they have visited some place than the experience just being a compilation of set of images.\r\n\r\n**Question 4**: During the time of the experience, which was strongest on the whole, your sense of being in the Egypt VR, or of being elsewhere? (**Average - 4.5**)\r\n\r\nParticipants who experienced intro and outro gave rating > 4 i.e, their sense of being in Egypt was high whereas participants who were not shown the intro and outro gave rating < 4. This concludes that intro and outro had a significant effect on a user's Sense of Presence. \r\n\r\n**Question 5**: Consider your memory of previous movies/ documentaries you have watched about egypt/pyramid/mummies. How similar in terms of that structure is this structure in the experience you have been today? (**Average - 4.83**)\r\n\r\nMajority of the participants found that their VR experience of Egypt was closer to what they have previously seen in movies or documentaries.\r\n\r\n**Question 6**: During the time of the experience, did you often think to yourself that you were actually in the Egypt VR? (**Average - 5.5**)\r\n\r\nSince the users were given instructions to navigate and perform the mummification process by audio instructions, they had no need to interact with the experimenter which in turn made them think that they were actually in the Egypt.\r\n\r\n## Education of Evaluation\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/spandananitdgp/Egyptian-Mummification-VR-Experience/blob/master/EdEval.PNG?raw=true)\r\n\r\nAs you can read in the section explaining the questionnaire, question no. 7 asks participants to rate their ‘prior’ knowledge about the Egyptian culture and Mummification process in general on a 5-point Likert Scale, where 5 indicates that user has competent knowledge in this domain and 1 indicates has no significant knowledge.\r\nWe asked all of our participants this question and the mean of the user rating for this question turned out to be **1.6**, as is it visible from the graph, which indeed indicates the fact that all of the participants did not possess strong knowledge about mummification process.\r\nAfter the VR experience was over, we asked user question no. 8 and discovered that the overall mean was increased by about **1.7** points (i.e. previously **1.6**, new **3.3**), which indicates that there was significant overall improvement in the education objective. Thus, from this experiment, it is evident that our learning objective was successfully achieved.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n1.
